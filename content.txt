 >attributes are called by itself and methods are called manually
3.why Python is called object oriented programming?-because everything in python is an object or attribute etc
4.Advantages of oops in python....
  >You can create own datatype in it.
  >Code reuse-ablity 
  >debug
  >easy to colab
5.End to end project(logogram-class)

  >dunder method or magic method in python
  >self
  >we can create attribute from outside class as well
  
  >encapsulation
  >getter and setter
  >static method

6.Inheritence
  >inheritence code example
  >why inheritence is needed?? (code reuseablity,parent class has no access to child class)
  >what get inherited?? (constructor,non-private attributes,non-private methods)
  >constructor overloading and method overloading
  >super keyword (can be used only inside the class,cannot access attributes/variables,used only inside child class )
  >Types of inheritence.  1.single inheritence 2.multilevel  3.heirarchical 4.Multiple(diamond problem) 5.hybrid
